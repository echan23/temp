#foodscraper

Hi, this is my nutrition app called TerpBites! It scrapes data from the University of Maryland's nutritional website, which contains nutrition facts on foods from the school diner. I used the BeautifulSoup Python library to scrape data for each item on the website, which I stored in an AWS RDS database. I then used a Flask-based app to build a RESTful API that connects to the database, enabling efficient data retrieval. The API serves nutritional data to the front end, which I built using React.js. The React application allows users to search for specific food items, view nutritional details, and even create customized meal plans by adding selected items to a personal meal tracker.
